#raw-data

This folder should contain all raw data. As needed add sub-folders.

The dataset purposefully contains some faulty entries that need to be cleaned.

I have saved the "codebook" in csv in the same folder 

This raw data-set should generally not be edited by hand. It should instead be loaded and processed/cleaned using code.
