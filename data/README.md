# data

The folders inside this folder contain all data at various stages.

This data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the `code` folders.

I have placed the raw data in the `raw-data` folder and please do not edit it. Ever!

I have placed the processed data in the `processed-data` folder and please do not edit it manually. Ever!

I only have a single processing step, therefore, only have one sub-folder for processed data.
